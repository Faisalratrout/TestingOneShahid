 I am  doing an ATM system that have login page , contains username / password/ balance , the user should do interactions with money in 5s , like 5/10/20/50 , if there is no money in the ATM the Admin should enter his account and put like ( eg :6 of 50 / 14 of 20 / 3 of 10 / 30 of 5 ) , and if the user don't have balance to get money it should display how much is there in his account , and the same concept of the admin he puts , it shows that he have eg : 2 of 20 , and so on , and when the user went to get. money from the ATM like 135 , should look the system and check how much the admin added to the ATM ( eg: 20 of 50 etc ) , the user when he wants the 135 the system should display after checking the amount and if there is enough of (2 of 50 etc ) it  took from 50s then 20s then 10s then 5s , if the 50 is 0  it took from 20s then 10s then 5s, and so on , like 135 ( 2 of 50 , 1 of 20 , 1 of 10 , 1 of 5 ) , if there is no money is enough , the admin should put more , else u canâ€™t use the ATM ,  it always check on the user Balance and if the ATM have the amount that enough .
